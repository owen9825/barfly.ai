We all want a bar like _Cheers_, where everybody knows your name – it's good for business. However, remembering everyone's name can be difficult, as can knowing when and how often your patrons visit your establishment. We're here to help you understand more about your patrons and how your business performs.

When people visit your bar, they're sharing a lot of information with you. We collect those insights and share them with you to make any changes that can improve your business.
